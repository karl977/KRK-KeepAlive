# KRK-KeepAlive
This repository contains a Python script to keep the KRK monitor speakers for going into sleep or standby mode automatically. To achieve that the script plays an inaudible tone to the speakers periodically, which "fools" the speakers to keep awake.
## Prerequisite
* Python 3
* Pip
* NumPy
* SoundDevice library
### Windows installation instructions
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
2. In elevated Powershell terminal run
    * `choco install python`
    * `choco install numpy`
3. In new terminal window run `pip install sounddevice`
## Usage
The script plays separate tone for the monitors and subwoofer, but will work without modification on a monitor only setup.
1. View the available sound device names with `python -m sounddevice`
2. In `main.py` change playback device name to a substring of your desired playback device
3. Run script with `python main.py`

Feel free to modify the script and all commented script variables when the script does not work for you.
### Low volume playback
The main reason I created this script was to enable using the KRK monitors at low volume without them going into standby.
1. Install [VoiceMeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm)
2. Launch it and set desired **HARDWARE OUT** device
3. Set **VoiceMeeter VAIO** Virtual input volume to -10dB
4. Set Windows playback device to **VoiceMeeter Input** (instead of VoiceMeeter AUX Input)
5. The script without modification will play the keep-alive signal to **Voicemeeter AUX Input**

As a result the keep-alive tone generated by the script will be played at 10dB higher volume than Windows sounds (music etc.) and the speakers will not go to sleep automatically.
